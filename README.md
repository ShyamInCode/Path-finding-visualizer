# A* Pathfinding Visualization

## Project Description
This project presents a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the A* pathfinding algorithm in action. The application generates a random maze and uses the A* algorithm to find the optimal path between two points. As the algorithm progresses, the GUI highlights visited nodes and the final path, providing real-time insight into the algorithm's operation.

## Features
- **Random Maze Generation**: Creates a new maze for each session, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
- **A* Algorithm Visualization**: Watch the A* algorithm as it searches for the shortest path.
- **Real-Time Progress**: Visited nodes are highlighted as the algorithm works, showing the real-time progress.
- **Path Highlighting**: Upon completion, the optimal path is clearly highlighted on the GUI.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the python installed on your computer.
3. Install pygame in your directory.
4. Run the application.
5. Interact with the GUI to generate mazes and visualize pathfinding.
